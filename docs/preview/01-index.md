# Introduction
Welcome to the Arcus Observability site! 🎉

## What is Arcus Observability?
Arcus Observability is an umbrella term for a set of NuGet packages `Arcus.Observability.*` that helps with abstracting away boilerplate code when tracking telemetry in applications. It allows you to minimize the infrastructure code in implementation code, while giving application developers a clear API to work with.

## Why should I use Arcus Observability?
Tracking telemetry in applications can be quite complex. Different services to inject, multi-dimensional contexts, different observability backends - each with their own clients. Arcus Observability capture these general concepts and provides an extensible API that is future proof for other observability backends.

## How to use Arcus Observability?
See our dedicated [getting started](./02-getting-started.md) page to take your first steps with Arcus Observability. Good luck!
