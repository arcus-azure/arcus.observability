# Write different telemetry types

Logs are a great way to gain insights, but sometimes they are not the best approach for the job.

We provide the capability to track the following telemetry types on top of ILogger with good support on Serilog:

- [Events](#events)
- Metrics
- Requests
- Dependencies

For most optimal output, we recommend using our [Azure Application Insights sink](/features/sinks/azure-application-insights).

## Installation

This feature requires to install our NuGet package

```shell
PM > Install-Package Arcus.Observability.Telemetry.Core
```

## Events

Events allow you to report custom events which are a great way to track business-related events.

Here is how you can report an `Order Created` event:

```csharp
logger.LogEvent("Order Created");
// Output: "Events Order Created (Context: )"
```

Contextual information is essential, that's why we provide an overload to give more information about the event:

```csharp
var telemetryContext = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    {"Customer", "Arcus"},
    {"OrderId", "ABC"},
};

logger.LogEvent("Order Created", telemetryContext);
// Output: "Events Order Created (Context: [Customer, Arcus], [OrderId, ABC])"
```
